# Power BI Sales Data Analysis Project
Welcome to my Power BI project on sales data analysis! This project consists of a landing page and two additional pages: Product Performance and Customer Insights.

### Landing Page
The landing page serves as a hub for the dashboard and includes a navigation menu that seamlessly directs the user to the other pages.

### Product Performance
The Product Performance page provides insights into the performance of different products.

### Customer Insights
The Customer Insights page provides insights into the performance of different customer groups.

### Data Exploration and Analysis
To facilitate data exploration and analysis, I have used bookmarks to create different scenarios such as MTD, YTD, and QTD analysis. Additionally, I have implemented drill-down functionality to enable users to delve deeper into the data and explore it at a more granular level. Furthermore, I have used tooltips to provide additional information and context to the visualizations.

Overall, this project is intended to deliver a clear storyline for the insights, with page order and analysis that help the end-user understand the data with minimal effort.

#### Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope you find the insights informative and useful!
